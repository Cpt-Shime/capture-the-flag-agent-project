# Capture the flag 

UNI project/competetion in capture the flag on turn based map with 3 agents...

# Idea
Idea to solve this without any complicated algorithams is to create an attacker for topside and botside of the map so each one moves alongside the unblocked line of the map (Most top and bot row), and have the third agent be a camper protecting the map. 
When attacking agents see the flag of the enemy they pick it up and return it back to our own flag.
